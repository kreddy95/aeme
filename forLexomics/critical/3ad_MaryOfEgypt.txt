Men þat ne hadden none wille swuch sunne forto do

For to hire sulue one heo seide þat schame it was to huyre

And iswoluwe hire ase heo þar on ȝeode into þe putte of helle

And þat euerech guod man þudere wolde for to honouri þat swete treo

And of þat craft þat ich ileorned habbe to eov ichulle beon prest and hende
Ȝe seide on of heom hast þou ȝwarof to aquiti þi schip huyre

Þo heo hadde to þulke ymage longue icrid and ibede
Mildeliche with careful heorte heo eode fram þulke stude
And eode hire to þe temple dore ac ȝuyt heo was sore of drad
Withoute lettingue In heo ȝeode welle þat heo was þo bliþe and glad
